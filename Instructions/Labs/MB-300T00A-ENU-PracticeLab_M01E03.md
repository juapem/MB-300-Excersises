## Create search queries

The **Advanced filter or sort** button from **Options** action pane tab launches
the inquiry dialog box in which you can select related and derived tables to the
form that you are working on. You can add derived tables into the **Range** tab
and choose your desired field(s) and assign criteria.

You can also set up and assign sorting, and date options, and view the joins
based on selected criteria.

Aside from the Default Dashboard, from anywhere in Dynamics 365 Finance apps,
you can directly access the inquiry dialog box with the shortcut key
**Ctrl+Shift+F3**.
